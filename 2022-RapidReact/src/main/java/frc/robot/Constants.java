 * The Constants class provides a convenient place for teams to hold robot-wide
 * numerical or boolean constants. This class should not be used for any other
 * purpose. All constants should be declared globally (i.e. public static). Do
 * not put anything functional in this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * It is advised to statically import this class (or one of its inner classes)
 * wherever the constants are needed, to reduce verbosity.
